### Description 

* Angular is so modular you can separate your JavaScript code like your controllers and services into multiple files.
  But adding all of the script references to your HTML might be painful. No worries there is a workaround to this problem.
* webpack is a module loader that works similar to how Node handles modules.
  With webpack you can install Angular using NPM, the Node Package Manager.
 
* This application basically  monitors the status of github.com and all its related services.

##

### Installation Instructions

* Open a command prompt in the project's root directory.

* Cd into that root folder you just cloned locally.

* Open terminal in the current folder and to install all dependencies type 

```javascript
   npm install 
```

* This installs the dependencies as defined in the package.json file

```javascript
   npm run bundle 
```

* By running this command example webpack will read and analyze the entry point and its dependencies (including transitive     dependencies).Then it will bundle them all into app.bundle.js.


* Now typing 

```javascript
   http-server
```

* It will launch the server on `http://172.18.0.1:8081`
